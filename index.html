                Overwatch 2 is a team-based shooter in which you play as a specific hero with a defined function rather than a generic soldier. Some characters are meant to protect the team, some cause significant damage, and others heal and support. When I play, what matters most is not only who wins, but whether or not our team can keep its synergy under stress. Matches can be turned in seconds. One poorly timed move or well-used ability can drastically change the outcome, making each moment feel critical and important.

                The game doesn't tell the story in the usual way. There is no storyline to play from start to finish. Instead, the story is presented in segments: animated shorts, character voice lines, and lore. At the core of it all is a world in which a peacekeeping organization known as Overwatch disbanded, and when new global dangers emerge, its former members are over time brought back. Every match feels like a return to that unresolved conflict, rather than driving the story ahead.

                Because of this setup, Overwatch 2 will never fully end. A match ends with a win or a loss, but you're nearly immediately assigned to another one. There is no final victory or ending scene. The game is based on repetition: learning, reacting, improving, and doing it all over again. That never-ending loop is a significant part of why the game continues drawing me back in.

                Brian Massumi's concept of impact helps explain why the game seems so intense. Massumi defines affect as an immediate, gut level reaction that occurs before we fully recognize it as an emotion. When I hear an enemy character shout a warning before using an ability, my body reacts instantly, I tense up, move without thinking, and experience a rush of adrenaline. Only afterward do I say to myself, "That loser missed" or scream in panic when my character has critical health. The game is continuously operating at a pre-conscious, emotional level.

                The concept of the simulacrum, as defined by Jean Baudrillard, also contributes to an understanding of Overwatch 2. The people and situations are exaggerated and polished versions of reality, bright colors, clear heroes and villains, and violence with no lasting effects. It is not intended to exactly depict real-world conflict, but rather to create something that is more entertaining and emotionally rewarding than reality itself. In that regard, Overwatch 2 shows warfare that is "more real than real."

                What makes Overwatch 2 fun for me is how it combines those two elements: powerful, physiological emotions and a virtual environment that is easy to enter. It's enjoyable because it's fast and emotional, but it's also intriguing because it shows how games don't require traditional endings or tales to be meaningful. Instead, Overwatch 2 keeps me hooked with emotion, repetition, and a world that seems alive every time I enter it.
